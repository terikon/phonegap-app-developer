# Changes from orininal phonegap-app-developer

This modified version supports access to DCIM folder, with [cordova-plugin-file](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-file/).

- cdvfile:// protocol is supported with config.xml, as described [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-file/#cdvfile-protocol).

- Permissions configuration with config.xml added with [cordova-custom-config](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-custom-config).

- Removed cordova-plugin-socialsharing as it breaks cordova-custom-config (waiting for fix, discussion is [here](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-custom-config/issues/51)).

- Removed com.wikitude.phonegap.WikitudePlugin as it just compiles too long.
